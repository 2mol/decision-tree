{-
Matrices with labeled rows and columns.

Construction functions handle uniqueness & correct length of labels.

Provides similar convenience functions to pandas DataFrames. Contrary to the latter, all
elements in the matrix contain only one type.

flatten v -- makes it into a vector, especially nice if the matrix is nx1 anyway.
